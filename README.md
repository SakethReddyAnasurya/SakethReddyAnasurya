- ⚡ Fun fact:
-    Did you know? The first ever computer bug was an actual bug! In 1947, Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, removed a moth from a relay in the Harvard Mark II computer. The moth was causing the machine to malfunction, so when it was removed, they said they had "debugged" the system. This is where the term "debugging a computer program" originated from! 🐛💻
